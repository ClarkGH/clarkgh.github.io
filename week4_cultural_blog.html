				<h1>Conflict and Myself</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I can see myself bragging about how amazing I am with conflict resolution (I'm really not) and how I currently work at a call center, how I, professionally, deal with it almost every day. I can brag about how I have a B.S. in Psychology with a focus on Clinical Psychology, and originally wanted to be a therapist. I can brag about how I worked in several different areas all having a lot to do with resolving conflicts professionally.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Regardless of my success in learning and working through conflict in a non-personal manner, it is a completely different beast from the conflicts in my personal life. I have had a conflicts and drama that had arisen in my life. They always are vastly different from conflict in a personal setting. This could be said about the conflicts I have between my friends and family.</p> 

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As personal as this blog is meant to be, I am very apprehensive about sharing the most recent personal conflict in my life, and avoiding giving offense is important to me. All I can say is that as people, we all get hurt, and we have to look for the best way to solve our issues. Sometimes that isn't the case and people say things that hurt other people.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  With the most recent conflict, someone said some very hurtful things that they had believed. The person was definitely being silly, but the words pierced deeply. I sat back, and listened. I usually try everything I can to fix things, but I knew it would be futile with this case. This friend of mine closed off and refuses to listen to anything I do or say, and won't return my calls. Perhaps with time wounds will heal, and as long as I do what I can to consistently improve and be a better person, everthing will mend.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When it comes to personal conflict, it takes two or more people to resolve these issues. One person cannot put in all the effort and expect things to be repaired. Conflict takes effort, humility, hearing out both sides, and working towards a compromise. When one person closes themself off and refuses to accept anything outside of their enforced beliefs, perhaps the best thing to do with the situation is to remain open to continually being there, but to walk away.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  In situations like that, there is really no way for me to go back in time. I can't do much differently, life is perfect the way it is now, and I just look forward to the things that will come my way. I am a huge believer in pieces of Frankl's logotherapy. It is best not to look back in the past years and wonder what we could have done better, or try to relive our youth, it is better instead to look forward to the future.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I learned mainly from this experience, that I can't fix everything. Sometimes time is the only cure to overcome conflict.</p>
