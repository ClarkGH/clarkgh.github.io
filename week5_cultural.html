				<h1>The Decay of Ruby</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Here I am, going to Dev Bootcamp. We are being taught Ruby, Rails, and all the associated frameworks necessary to build meaningful and useful web applications. We are also being taught that Ruby is dying, and we shoud consistently be learning other languages and moving beyond where we are.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I've done much research, and while yes, the decay of languages is a very common thing and most languages have their associated raising and lowering of their tides, Ruby has been at its peak and will taper off but not disappear. Twitter made it cool, and while it looks like Twitter had moved away from the Rails framework a few years ago, there is still a lot of application.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ruby rose into its highest level of use and popularity in 2009, from there it slowly went down, and today it is at a fairly steady rate of usage for web developers, according to the TIOBE index for Ruby. Today Ruby has a larger amount of Modules than Node.js, as well as PyPI, however Node.js is growing more rapidly.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Even if Ruby is no longer the "in" language, the amount of jobs available to a Rails developer are still growing at a steady to high rate, and there seem to be a lot of need in the industry for rails developers. </p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So why is Ruby dying exactly? Possibly because it isn't the fastest language, especially when compared to the other kids on the block. It gets outperformed in a lot of ways. Ruby isn't helping businesses work with their customers, in a lot of ways it just is not as efficient in comparison to other languages. Even with all of this, it looks like there is hope for people who utilize Ruby, and there is a possible future if <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/ruby-rails/rubinius-seeks-modernize-not-bury-the-ruby-language-229445">Rubinius X</a> works out.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm not going to lie, this scares me. I really want Ruby to stay alive because I've begun to fall in love with the language. It's so elegant, like the girlfriend I wish I had. I don't want to cheat on her, (except maybe with Node.js, semicolons err'day).</p>
