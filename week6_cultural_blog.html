				<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stereotype threat is a specific type of a self-fulfilling prophecy. A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction made that comes true mainly because the prophecy was made. This is because people's beliefs influence our actions. In the case of stereotype threat, stereotypes are given and people begin to believe or try to fight against the prophecies and they become true for whatever reason.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Coming from a psychology based background, earning my bachelor's in the field, I remember reading multiple studies that reviewed multiple events with regards to sterotype threat. In 2008, when I was in college, I recall reading Steel and Anderson's <a href="http://mrnas.pbworks.com/f/claude+steele+stereotype+threat+1995.pdf">study</a> that first defined stereotype threat as a very real issue. In several experiments they had given several tests to both black and white students. When they had said that black students generally performed worse than white students, the black students' test scores were lower than their white peers. When there was no reference to performance with regards to race, the black students performed equally as well as their white counterparts. This study showed that performance in academics can be harmed when put in the light of racial or any other stereotypes.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There have been many studies made since the 90s that support the fact that stereotype threat still exists. The best way for us to avoid stereotype threat is to throw all preconceptions and ideas on how the world works away. Even science has proven that there is no major genetic or biological difference in terms of athleticism or intelligence when it comes to different races. So why do stereotypes exist? Because we continue believing them and creating new ones.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is actually a little difficult for me to express, since I don't like sharing what I think politically or religiously. I hope my display of just a few of my personal beliefs is fine. Please don't be offended with the following. We've all felt stereotype threat in some way or another. I personally was raised Mormon, so everyone expected me to be super religious, to be against gay marriage, to be clean shaven, and to not drink caffeine. I bet that when any of you read this blog, especially those that aren't Mormon are already thinking of your own stereotypes. What am I to you knowing that I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints? Do you assume that I'm religious? Do you assume that I'm a republican? Do you have negative thoughts or beliefs about me just because of those reasons?</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Most of the earlier beliefs used to be true about me. I was given expectations in my youth by my family, by my religion, and by my friends, and I lived them. I went on a mission, I was conservative, and I was misguided on how homosexuality worked. In my ignorance, I actually went to BYU, the world's most mormon school. Interestingly, everything I thought and believed had changed from my amazing and wonderful professors. During my tenure at BYU, I took many psychology classes that focused on introspection and personal growth. These classes helped me change the great majority of my personal beliefs, and now I am much more open and accepting.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I actually left my religion for a time because my politics greatly differ from the whole. I've returned and I actively work with a group called Mormons for Equality. I'm a huge supporter of gay marriage, and while that may in itself offend you, I will always respect everyone's right to their own opinion and belief system. I don't know how I avoided the whole concept of getting married super young, like most mormons, because that was definitely expected of me. However, I support the belief that everyone should be able to love and marry, or not marry, whom they choose. </p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The best way we can overcome our differences, our hatreds, our ignorance, and our stereotypes, is to accept everyone regardless of what our pretentious preconceptions tell us. We shouldn't automatically dislike or assume things about someone because they look, act, or believe differently than we, ourselves, do. If we see someone struggling and they think they cannot do something, we should find ways to help them and cause them to improve. I feel that the most welcoming environment is the one where friendship is found; it isn't forced, and everyone works on lifting eachother up and helping one another to improve. We should also never be afraid to stand up and point out and fight against things bringing us down.</p>
