      <h2>Who I am:</h2>

Known for my dashing good looks, my keen senses, and my obvious humility. I have a deep love for learning new things as well as always keeping life fresh and exciting.</p>

      <h3>Where I come from:</h3>
        </br>
        <p>I initially was born and raised in California, but claim Denver to be my home. I graduated from BYU in April 2012 with a Bachelors degree in Psychology. I initially wanted to be a therapist, but had a change of heart after some experiences and decided that it <em>wasn't</em> the path for me. I ended up selling insurance for a year until ultimately I had decided that I wanted to code. </p>
        </br>

      <h4>Why I'm going to <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp:</a></h4>
        </br>
          <p>Coming from a past where I did <em>basic</em> programming as a hobby, I've decided now to dive <strong> deeper </strong> into the ocean of coding and make it my permanent vocation.</p>
          </br>
