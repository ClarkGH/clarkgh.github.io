			<h1>My Three Favorite Sites and how they Relate to me as a Developer</h1>
			</br>
		</header>
		<section>
			<h1>Reddit</h1>
			<p>  At first glance when I went to reddit I thought it wasn't very interesting. It had a very simple layout and did not appeal to me. The site is still very simple, but it has a ton of content provided by the users.</p>
			<p>  The focus of the site is very simple, allow users to post links, thoughts, and comments as a community. The more popular posts get upvotes, and the less popular posts get downvotes.</p>
			<p>  I would not say that the site is very easy to navigate. The initial user experience is lacking and nothing truly draws you in. It takes some time to be drawn into the information sink that is reddit. Once you do get drawn in, you're there to stay.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Twitter</h1>
			<p>  Twitter is extremely useful for keeping up with news and articles from my favorite providers. It also allows me to stay on top of what's going on in my friends' and colleagues professional lives. I know that a lot of people use it as a soap box, but to me it's a place to connect to information and give some of mine out.</p>
			<p>  Twitter is very easy to look at, very simple and yet elegant with its design. It's extremely easy to follow who you want and ignore the rest (unlike facebook). It has inumerable links to content.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Netflix</h1>
			<p>  Netflix is my goto veg-out website when I need a break from the world. It's made with Microsoft silverlight and is very easy to navigate. They have a ton of multimedia, and in terms of web, they make everything extremely accessible.</p>
			<p>  In terms of content, they have thousands of hours worth of movies and television shows. A person could waste their life away their if they wanted. Again, Netflix is a time-sink.</p>
