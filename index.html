					<article><h1>Who I am:</h1>
						<p>I am a 28 year old intellectual outdoorsman with a hunger for self improvement and learning. I have a degree in psychology and have a deep love for all things technology. I can be found reading non-fiction, rock-climbing, and playing video games.</p>

						<h1>What I'm Doing:</h1>
						<p>I'm here at Dev Bootcamp for a lot of reasons. I had been in a situation that I wasn't happy with, so I packed my bags, quit my job, and moved to Utah. Through a process of retrospection, I decided that I wanted to code. I had enjoyed programming when I was in middle school and highschool from what I had done, I just never made it something I wanted to make a career out of. Until now.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p>I'm more than excited to be a part of this program, to learn and to grow in this short period of time. It's been amazing so far!</p>
