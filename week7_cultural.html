				<h1>My Values and Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Revisiting my values on my first cultural blog entry and connecting it with the previous stereotype threat entry, I found a few ways for me to work past stereotype threat. Mainly finding challenges make me want to work harder, so anytime people assume things about me, I take it as a challenge to take what they're saying, assess if it's good or bad, and then improve upon the good and correct the bad if it ends up being true.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As long as I have a supportive community of friends around me, and I'm accomplishing great things through hard work, I know I will be just fine with everything at DevBootcamp. I've noticed that working with several people who are already in the same cohort as I am, I was able to grow past where I was initially. Several people have already helped in improving my understanding as well as lifting me where I was with my knowledge in coding.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp One other thing that really helps is feeling like I have accomplished something. The way I get to feel that way is by setting goals and then reaching them. I generally keep a planner with goals written down with objectives that I want to reach by that day. It does get in the way of my personal life if I set too strict of goals, so I make sure to have my goals to be a little loose.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In terms of exercises that will help me overcome the downtimes that have been, or will be, I have a few things that help me feel great. The first is exercise, I train for and run races, and the adrenaline always makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. I have a global gym membership at 24 Hour Fitness and I know there's a location close to the DBC program. In addition to exercise, when I feel overwhelmed, I always like to take a moment to myself and meditate. Meditation frees me from a lot of internal pain and helps me to grow.</p>
