				<h1>Peer Programming Sessions and Feedback</h1>
				<h2>3/28/2014</h2>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To say the least, pairing with others and pairing together is an amazing experience. I've learned faster, had cleaner code, and was able to look at different methodologies of solving problems. When we had challenges arise, we were both able to look at the code, review information together, run ideas off eachother's head, and grow from our experience.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I really enjoyed getting to know the people I've paired with. I feel like I was able to connect on a personal level with most of them and I couldn't have felt any better about myself than when things came together as they did. I wasn't frustrated at all with them.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When it comes to getting feedback, I feel that some of the feedback I was given should have been said at the end of the pairing session. If someone feels something that I should work on, I appreciate boldness and feedback that I can use to improve myself on. With that being said, I will utilize the feedback and work as hard as I can to be the best as possible.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I think it's important to note that everyone is different, and everyone's peer session preferences will also vary, so as long as you're being as open minded and willing to work, listen, and give your output, everything should work out great. I'm going to continue to listen to people and do all I can to be the perfect partner for everyone.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When it came to writing feedback, it was alright. I wrote down everything I had said during the session and no more or less. I think the most difficult thing for me was worrying about how the person would receive my feedback. I definitely don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or step on any toes. I guess I should work on not being a people pleaser.</p>
				<p> Overall, pair sessions and feedback are both fantastic. I look forward for the future!</p>
