				<h1>When I'm Happy and Why: A Mindfulness Post</h1>
				<h2>3/20/14</h2>
				<p>There have been a lot of times when I've been happy, and I'm not ranking the times of my happiness. Here are just a few values that I can recall being a part of my happiness:</p>
				<p>Challenges, Accomplishment, Community, and Spirituality/Tranquility.</p>
				<p>In my life I find that when I'm the happiest I have persisted through a tough project and have found success through my many errors. I find happiness in the moment that I have been struggling where everything seems to reach a point of zen and I have that "AHA" moment that makes me feel accomplished.</p>
				<p>I always have to have something challenging me, or a goal to reach, or I am not as happy as I can be otherwise. This is why I train for races, this is why I'm going to do an Iron Man, and this is why I'm becoming a developer. To be consistently learning and challenging myself, to reach those "AHA" or "I did it!" moments that make me feel like I am accomplishing something with my life.</p>
				<p>I fight to learn.</p>
				<p>I also find a great deal of happiness when I'm fighting to improve alongside people I care about. Not necessarily at the moment, but I learn to care about the people who are challenging me and wanting to grow with me. I have a lot of love for the people around me, and I want everyone in the program to succeed. It scares me that there might be some people drop out of the program, especially after I've learned to love them. It'll make me more than happy to see everyone succeed.</p>
				<p>Finally, I love the tranquility and calm that comes when I'm outdoors. When I'm rock climbing or hiking, I can always take a moment to overlook nature's beauty and just give myself a moment to reflect while I'm away from the rest of the world. Meditation, prayer, and self-reflection are always there for me and they always bring about a sense of peaceful happiness. As such, I'm trying to meditate everyday.</p>
				<p>On a scale from one to five, I more than definitely fight to live up to these values. I always try to challenge myself and become the best that I can be, I fight to succeed and get the accomplishment, I take care of those around me, and I give time to myself to think.</p>
				<p>As an answer to the last time when someone had asked for my advice on something? That was actually the day I posted this blog. The topic was with regards to HTML and CSS files.</p>
