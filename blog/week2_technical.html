				<h1>Why is Javascript So Popular?</h1>
				</br>
				<h2>3/20/14</h2>
				<p>  Javascript was created in 1995 by Netscape as a dynamic programming language. With regards to the web, it allows client-side scripts to work on the client's (user's computer) side to interact with the user. It is mainly used in client-side applications, however it has been used in other areas as well.</p>
				<p>  Regardless, the many uses for javascript today don't mean that it's always been so popular. Around 2005 the language's use had dwindled severely, then Google Maps magically came out and brought with it a lot more uses for the language.</p>
				<p>  Today, Javascript has had several new frameworks arise since it's inception over 20 years ago, and it seems to continue to be just as popular as ever. We now have frameworks like JQuery, Durandel, Angular, Backbone, and etc. making Javascript more useful.</p>
				<p>  So why do we keep using it? Many reasons, we don't need to compile the language (just think of this as taking a shortcut making your trip a lot shorter), we don't need a virtual machine to load it (another shortcut), it's coded very similarly to many other languages (easier to code if you already know another language), almost every browser supports it, it's client based and not server based (less strain on the server), and it already works with many web-based apps.</p>
				<p>  Javascript is a great language to learn in the tech field due to it's many uses. Not only does it make the server's life easier, but it also connects to the user automatically. Now that we have new frameworks to work alongside, we can build bridges over the gaps that Javascript has had in the past.</p>
