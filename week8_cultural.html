				<h1>Entering the Kitchen of Dev Bootcamp</h1>
				<h2>5/1/2014</h2>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From <a href=""> this video</a> given to us from the great people at DBC, I'm both scared and excited for my experiences that are coming in the next few weeks. There's a lot for me to really say, and I've said a lot of this before in my Blogger account which I've actually linked at the top of this blog. I took quite a few notes from Shereef's video, but if I went over all of them this entry would become quite large and I'm sure no one would read, not even I would want to read it.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With that being said, Shereef initially discussed DBC's beginnings as a place where he had no idea what he was doing and how the program has evolved from there. He connected DBC to how the program started where the fridge stopped working in the kitchen, where they needed to change lightbulbs and how they had all worked together to make it work</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All of us going to DBC are going to learn how to cook and prepare these amazing code dishes, and while we cannot become master chefs in just 9 short weeks, we can definitely start preparing that awesome foundation that will lead to us being those future kickass code chefs. DBC does just that, they give us all the tools necessary to be the best we can be.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp One of the major factors leading towards my fear from going to DBC is failure. I'm afraid that the loan I took out, leaving my job, not getting a degree in computer science, and somehow my effort, will all bite me in the proverbial ass and I'll fail. I'm afraid that I won't get a career started, I'm afraid that I won't be able to support myself, and I'm afraid that I wont make it through DBC.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm going to go on a brief tangent here, but we had sent out e-mails to the instructors at DBC, the first week of phase 0, as one of our cultural assignments listing out our fears, and I felt like my fear was misplaced. Everyone else had such great motivating fears and I had felt like mine was selfish. From watching the video, I now know that a lot of the people at DBC feel the same way. </p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I may not be an amazing entrepeneur, I may not have a carreer to fall back on, I may not have loads of money, but I do have an amazing work ethic that will help me struggle and fight through DBC. Also getting to know everyone has pretty much alleviated all of these fears.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From everything shown in the video, I feel like Dev Bootcamp is more of a community that pushes people to their limits. It asks us only to give all we can, and no more. They build us up through mindfulness activities, tells us to not code during our amazing hour and a half lunches, and they have people there to listen to our vulnerable insights that will do nothing but give us amazingly beneficial feedback.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Having only been in phase 0 for the brief, albeit amazing, 8 weeks; I can honestly say that I am confident in my success more than my failure. The fellow students are extremely supportive and amazing, the coaches and instructors I've worked with are fantastic, and I've had nothing but a blast working through all of the exercices they've given. I want to work with more people like the ones I have in the real world.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If all of my co-workers were as dedicated, as kind, or as innovative as the people I've worked with, I would be in the best work environment ever. The culture I have seen, and the culture I am preparing to enter in less than a week and a half is just phenomenal.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Look out DBC, I'm putting in all the effort I can to be as amazing as I can be. I'm excited to help those around me and vice versa. I really do feel like nothing can hold us back.</p>
