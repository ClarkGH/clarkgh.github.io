				<h1>Loops in Ruby</h1>
				<h2>3/28/2014</h2>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In programming, there is something called looping, where a block of code is repeated several times until it meets a set amount of requirements. Programmers use these 'loops' to make both theirs and the users' lives easier. Loops not only save a programmer from a great deal of work, they also make the filesize less bulky.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With ruby, there are several different ways to loop, but they all loop differently. There generally is a loop more appropriate for set situations, and decided what works best depends on what you're looking for.</p>
				<ol> 
					<li><strong>While</strong></li>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp The While loop will loop continuously as long as the condition given remains true. This is useful when you want your code to loop while the condition you want remains true.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>while condition do</br>&nbsp&nbsp code to do <br> end</i></p>
					<li><strong>Until</strong></li>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp The until loop will loop continuously as until the condition given remains true. This is best used when you know you want your code to stop looping when it reaches a certain point. This works opposite to while.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>until condition do</br>&nbsp&nbsp code to do <br> end</i></p>
					<li><strong>For</strong></li>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp The for loop will loop through every item (or element) in a given range. If we know our range, this works best. Most ruby programmers prefer the each do syntax.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>(expression).each do |element| <br>&nbsp&nbsp code_to_do <br> end</i></p>
					<li><strong>Break</strong></li>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp The Break loop will break out of the most internal loop. This is useful if you have specific parameters you want to end the loop.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax (with for loop):</p>
					<p><i>for variable in range given</br>&nbsp&nbsp if variable meets condition then <br>&nbsp&nbsp break <br>end </i></p>
					<li><strong>Next</strong></li>
					<p>The Next loop will move to the next loop. If we want to jump loops this is useful.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>for variable in range given</br>&nbsp&nbsp if variable meets condition then <br>&nbsp&nbsp next <br>end </i></p>
					<li><strong>Redo</strong></li>
					<p>The Redo loop will restart the loop "iteration" and doesn't check the loop condition. If you want to restart the loop's iteration and not the whole loop when conditions are met, this is the loop to choose.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>for variable in range given</br>&nbsp&nbsp if variable meets condition then <br>&nbsp&nbsp redo <br>end </i></p>
					<li><strong>Retry</strong></li>
					<p>The retry loop will restart the entire loop over again and not just the iteration. If you want your loop to restart if certain conditions are met, this is what you would want to use.</p>
					<p>Pseudocode Syntax:</p>
					<p><i>for variable in range given</br>&nbsp&nbsp if variable meets condition then <br>&nbsp&nbsp retry <br>end </i></p>
