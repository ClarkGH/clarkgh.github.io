				<h1>Classes for the Non-Coder</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I remember when I was in my first month learning Ruby. I had been on a computer all day going through different tracks on different websites studying up on the language and I had barely any free time. I had set time aside to spend with a nurse friend of mine, and she had asked me what I had been working on. I told her that I was learning to code, with which she responded, "Please don't code on me." I guess, she thought I was making a medical joke. While the heading of this entry works for both people who aren't flatlining, I specifically am aiming this entry to be easily understood by people that do not program.</p>
			
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As someone who has a light understanding of programming, which is changing day by day, I definitely understand that reading someone's code initially is like reading another language. This is one of the reason's why I am excited that my first real in depth process of learning and programming is with Ruby. Ruby is one of the easiest languages to read and write in, and it definitely makes life easier for the beginner.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp One of the best ways to understand Ruby is for me to say this, Ruby is based off of objects. Everything in Ruby is an object. One of the main and important objects that makes my life easier in Ruby is called the Class. A Class is essentially a blueprint that is both an object and contains the designs for several objects that are nestled inside of it.</p>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the case of a car, the car is our class. This car is our object but it requires several parts to work. Our car will need several other objects to be built. Inside our blueprint, we'll need wheels, an engine, a gas tank, and a steering wheel. Once we have our pieces, our car has been built. We could get a little bit more complex and discuss classes inside of classes, but in this case, we just wanted to build our car.</p>
				<p> With Ruby, we use classes and build our class with several different functions or methods that do everything our class needs to get done. Simple, and elegant.</p>
