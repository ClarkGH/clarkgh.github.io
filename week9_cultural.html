				<h1>Feedback</h1>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This entire time at Dev Bootcamp has been a constant feedback session. The first week involved several videos and readings all about giving and accepting feedback, one of which was from one of the DBC chief's, Kareem. The main point that he drove in was to give kind, specific, and actionable feedback while avoiding the proverbial poop sandwich.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Kareem's method has been something of a goal of mine. I have been working intensely on being able to give great feedback while avoiding the poop. From the experience I've had as a manager, as a ropes course facilitator, as a potential therapist, and as a person, I had never really thought about giving feedback as something someone had needed training for. Sure I had to train people and give direction in several of my jobs, but the experience was invaluable.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At DBC, I was able to improve at my ability in giving feedback. The mindfulness readings were fantastic and I took each opportunity I could to pair with people. From this, I learned the best way for me to give such feedback. I feel that some people may not know how to give advice.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I just want to mention the poop sandwich, never give someone a nice compliment that has nothing to do with the material you're giving feedback on on to soften the blow. It makes feedback less meaningful, you seem less confident, and you also lose some validity. If you have something to compliment, then make sure it's meaningful and real.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In terms of being kind, give the feedback in a polite and a kind manner. Don't be blunt, and don't be rude. There is always a way to be confident and kind at the same time.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When it comes to being specific, all you need to do is point out precise moments attached to what you're discussing. This can involve specific pieces of code, specific actions, or anything else specific there is to go off of. We can only give advice when we have something to give advice for. You shouldn't try to squeeze ketchup on a burger if there is no ketchup in the bottle.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In terms of being actionable, tell them how they can improve. Research something, work on something, read something, anything. The actions that they can take to become better at whatever it is are there to take.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beyound the things taught to us to do at DBC, I personally prefer to give feedback directly to a person, verbally, as soon as the pairing session or event is over. I feel that receiving feedback in the written form or later is a waste. </p> 

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From my psychology background, I know I say that a lot, I do know how memory works and all the fun neuropsychological functions attached to it. It's both best memory-wise and confidence-wise for me to give it right away. I also feel that people trust my feedback more because I'm not afraid to give it to them directly instead of a roundabout way.</p>
